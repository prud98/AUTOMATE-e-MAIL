# AUTOMATE-e-MAIL
This python program sends our email to receiver automatically without asking our login credentials every time ....!

NOTE:FOR THIS PROGRAM TO WORK,"ALLOW LESS SECURE APPS" IN EMAIL SETTINGS.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What criteria is used to identify an application as being “less secure”?
->Applications that rely on plain username/password authentication to access an account programmatically are considered less secure than those using modern day security standards such as OAuth 2.0.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT:
we use a library called SMTP(import smtplib) to access the email fuctionalities like login/logout and sending email.
->make sure that smtp library is available in your workspace environment(although it is available default!)
